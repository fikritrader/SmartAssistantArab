A wild boar was rubbing his tusks against a tree.
A fox passing by asked him what he was doing.
"My tusks are my weapons," said the boar. "I'm sharpening them."
"Why waste time sharpening your weapons when there's no danger in sight?" said the fox. "You're being foolish."
Just then a hunter appeared on the scene.
Frightened by the boar's sharpened tusks, he turned on the fox instead and shot him dead.$$
Two roosters fought for supremacy in the farmyard.
Finally one was vanquished and he went and hid himself in a corner of the hen-house.
Defeated by PrideThe victor flew up to the roof of the barn and begin to crow, �I�ve won, I�ve won!"
An eagle swooped down and carried him away and the rooster that had been defeated suddenly found himself unchallenged master of the farmyard.$$
A fox, observing a fish cart coming, lay down and pretended to be dead.
The cart man, tempted by the idea of making some money by selling the fox's fur, picked up the animal by its tail and flung it into the back of the cart among the fish.
Then he resumed his journey. The fox ate his fill of the fish and jumped out of the cart.
A wolf saw him jumping out and asked him what he had been doing in it. The fox told him and also how he had got into it in the first place.
The wolf ran ahead of the cart and lay down in its path, pretending to be dead.
The cart man was delighted to find another animal to sell, but he found the animal too heavy to lift.
So he pushed it into a sack, tied the sack to his cart and dragged it away.$$
A fox sneaked into a farm and grabbed a prize rooster.
The farmer saw him and raised the alarm and he and his dogs started chasing the thief.
The fox, though he was holding the rooster in his mouth, was running very fast.
"Get him! Get him!" shouted the farmer to his dogs.
"No!" suddenly screamed the rooster. "Don't come near me!"
"My master was very cruel to me," explained the rooster to the fox. "Tell him to stay away from me."
The fox was delighted. "He wants you to stay away from him!" he shouted at the farmer, in the process releasing his hold on the rooster.
The rooster flew up into a tree and stayed there till he was rescued by his master.$$
The cranes were eating grain from his field, so the farmer set a trap and caught several of them.
Among them was a stork.
�You can see I don�t belong here," said the stork. �I�m a law- abiding bird. Please let me go."
You may well be what you claim to be," said the farmer. �But I caught you along with these robbers, so you will have to hang with them."$$
A fir tree said boastingly to the bramble bush growing in its shade:
�You are useless. Nobody wants you. I am everywhere used for roofs and houses. Men can�t do without me."
�You�re so right," said the bramble. �Here�s a man coming to you with an axe, right now. Farewell."$$
A monkey climbed the roof of a house and entertained the people who had gathered below to watch it, with its antics.
After it had gone, an ass who craved popularity climbed the roof and tried to perform the same tricks.
In the process, it dislodged and broke several tiles.
The owner of the house was furious.
His servants went up, drove the ass down, and beat it black and blue.$$
A man who wanted to be known as a fearless hunter set out to bag game.
He found the tracks of a lion and followed them till they disappeared in stony ground.
Just then, a woodcutter came by.
Pale Hunter�Look here, my man," said the hunter grandly. "I was following a lion and have lost his tracks. Can you help me find them again?"
""There's no need to look for his tracks," said the woodcutter. "I'll take you to the lion himself."
The hunter turned pale.
"The l-lion," he said, "no, no, just show me his tracks."$$
Two travelers, seeking respite from the searing heat of the midday sun, took shelter under a leafy tree.
They soon felt cool and refreshed.
�What sort of tree is this? Does it produce edible fruits?" asked one of the men to the other.
�It�s a plane tree," said his companion. �Don�t waste your time looking for fruits. It produces neither edible fruits nor good wood. It�s one of the most useless trees around."
�How can you say that when you�re enjoying my shade at this very moment?" snapped the tree.$$
A young deer said to his mother, �I�m larger than a dog and swifter and I have horns to defend myself with. Yet when a dog appears I run away with the others. I have decided not to run from dogs, in future."
Just then they heard the bark of a dog.
The young deer was filled with fear and forgetting his resolve, took to his heels along with his mother and the rest of the herd.$$
A dog spotted a rabbit and started chasing him, but the rabbit got away.
Seeing this, a goat stopped to gloat.
"Too fast for you, wasn't he?" he sneered.
"Why are you surprised?" said the dog. "I was chasing him for fun; he was running for his life."$$
A sick stag was lying in a corner, helpless and weak.
He was glad he had collected enough grass to last him through his period of illness.
But suddenly, to his dismay, he saw that some friends who had come to see him were helping themselves to the food.
"Please go away," he said. "My illness will not kill me but your greed certainly could."$$
One day a wolf cornered a sheep.
"You can't escape," said the wolf, baring his teeth.
"I know," said the sheep, softly.
"Please grant me a last wish. Sing a song so that I may dance one last time.'
"Certainly,' said the wolf and throwing back his head began to howl.
Hearing him howl the farmer's dogs rushed to the spot and drove him away.$$
There was once a dog that used to run up quietly behind people and bite their heels.
Fed up of the numerous complaints, the owner tied a bell around the dog�s neck so that the sound of the bell would alert people whenever the animal came near them.
The dog felt the bell was a reward of some sort and became extremely conceited, turning up his nose whenever he met other dogs on the street.
One day a hound brought him down to earth with some plain speaking and when the dog learnt why the bell had been put around his neck he slunk away in shame.$$
An oil-lamp, observing how well it was lighting up the area around it, was filled with pride.
"Even the sun could not do better!" he boasted.
Just then the wind started to blow and the lamp went out.
"Next time you think of comparing yourself to the sun," said its owner, re-lighting it, "remember the sun doesn't have to be re-lit."$$
A shipwrecked man struggled mightily against the waves and was finally cast ashore, more dead than alive.
When finally he regained consciousness, he saw that the sea was as calm as a pond.
"How deceitful you are!" he shouted to the sea. "You draw men unto you showing your peaceful side but when they are in your power you wreak fury against them!"
The sea took the form of a woman to defend herself.
"Blame me not!" said the woman. "I'm always peaceful. It is the wind that creates waves and turns me into a monster."$$
A gnat, annoyed with a lion, for disturbing its sleep with its roaring, stung the beast on its snout.
The lion tried to crush it with its paws but without success.
The insect dodged the great cat�s claws and stung it again on its face.
Elated by its victory over the king of beasts, the gnat turned to gloat.
Unfortunately, there was a web in its path. It got caught in the web, and was devoured by the spider.
An insignificant foe is sometimes more dangerous than a mighty adversary because we�re not on guard against it.$$
Rabbits are among the most timid of animals.
The rabbits of a colony once had a meeting to discuss this trait of theirs.
They came to the conclusion that as their fearness would never leave them, they were doomed to a miserable existence and it would be better to drown themselves and end their misery once and for all.
Accordingly, they began to move towards a large lake.
When the frogs in the lake saw the large number of rabbits approaching, they were filled with fear and made for the deepest part of the lake.
Seeing this, the leader of the rabbits stopped and said to his fellow-creatures: "It is true we are timid, but here are animals more timid than ourselves. There is hope for us yet. Let us go back to our homes."
And that is what they did.$$
One day a man stopped Birbal in the street and began narrating his woes to him.
"I've walked twenty miles to see you," he told Birbal finally, "and all along the way people kept saying you were the most generous man in the country."
Birbal knew the man was going to ask him for money.
"Are you going back the same way?" he asked.
"Yes," said the man.
"Will you do me a favor?"
"Certainly," said the man. "What do you want me to do?"
"Please deny the rumor of my generosity," said Birbal, walking away.$$
One fine morning, a minister from Emperor Akbar's court had gathered in the assembly hall.
He informed the Emperor that all his valuables had been stolen by a thief the previous night.
Akbar was shocked to hear this because the place where that minister lived was the safest place in the kingdom.
He invited Birbal to solve the mystery. Akbar said "It is definitely not possible for an outsider to enter into the minister's house and steal the valuables. This blunder is definitely committed only by another minister of that court." Saying so, he arranged for a donkey to be tied to a pillar. He ordered all the courtiers to lift the donkey's tail and say "I have not stolen."
Birbal added "Only then we can judge the culprit." After everyone had finished, he asked the courtiers to show their palm to him. All the courtiers except Alim Khan had a black patch of paint on their palm. Birbal had actually painted the donkey's tail with a black coat of paint. In the fright, the guilty minister did not touch the donkey's tail at all. Thus Birbal once again proved his intelligence and was rewarded by the king with 1000 gold coins.$$
One day Akbar asked his courtiers if they could tell him the difference between truth and falsehood in three words or less.
The courtiers looked at one another in bewilderment.
"What about you, Birbal?" asked the emperor. "I'm surprised that you too are silent."
"I'm silent because I want to give others a chance to speak," said Birbal.
"Nobody else has the answer," said the emperor. "So go ahead and tell me what the difference between truth and falsehood is � in three words or less."
"Four fingers" said Birbal
"Four fingers?" asked the emperor, perplexed.
"That's the difference between truth and falsehood, your Majesty," said Birbal. "That which you see with your own eyes is the truth. That which you have only heard about might not be true. More often than not, it's likely to be false."
"That is right," said Akbar. "But what did you mean by saying the difference is four fingers?'
"The distance between one's eyes and one's ears is the width of four fingers, Your Majesty," said Birbal, grinning.$$
A farmer and his neighbor once went to Emperor Akbar's court with a complaint.
"Your Majesty, I bought a well from him," said the farmer pointing to his neighbor," and now he wants me to pay for the water."
"That's right, your Majesty," said the neighbor. "I sold him the well but not the water!"
The Emperor asked Birbal to settle the dispute.
"Didn't you say that you sold your well to this farmer?" Birbal asked the neighbor. "So, the well belongs to him now, but you have kept your water in his well. Is that right? Well, in that case you will have to pay him a rent or take your water out at once."
The neighbor realized that he was outwitted. He quickly apologized and gave up his claim.$$
Birbal was in Persia at the invitation of the king of that country.
Parties were given in his honor and rich presents were heaped on him.
On the eve of his departure for home, a nobleman asked him how he would compare the king of Persia to his own king.
�Your king is a full moon," said Birbal. �Whereas mine could be likened to the quarter moon."
The Persians were very happy. But when Birbal got home he found that Emperor Akbar was furious with him.
�How could you belittle your own king!" demanded Akbar. �You are a traitor!"
�No, Your Majesty," said Birbal. �I did not belittle you. The full moon diminishes and disappears whereas the quarter moon grows from strength to strength. What I, in fact, proclaimed to the world is that your power is growing from day to day whereas that of the king of Persia is about to go into decline."
Akbar grunted in satisfaction and welcomed Birbal back with a warm embrace.$$
The Emperor Akbar was traveling to a distant place along with some of his courtiers. It was a hot day and the emperor was tiring of the journey.
�Can�t anybody shorten this road for me?" he asked, querulously.
�I can," said Birbal.
The other courtiers looked at one another, perplexed. All of them knew there was no other path through the hilly terrain.
The road they were traveling on was the only one that could take them to their destination.
�You can shorten the road?" said the emperor. �Well, do it."
�I will," said Birbal. �Listen first to this story I have to tell."
And riding beside the emperor�s palanquin, he launched upon a long and intriguing tale that held Akbar and all those listening, spellbound. Before they knew it, they had reached the end of their journey.
�We�ve reached?" exclaimed Akbar. �So soon!"
�Well," grinned Birbal, �you did say you wanted the road to be shortened."$$
One day the Emperor Akbar startled his courtiers with a strange question.
"If somebody pulled my whiskers what sort of punishment should be given to him?" he asked.
"He should be flogged!" said one courtier.
"He should be hanged!" said another.
"He should be beheaded!" said a third.
"And what about you, Birbal?" asked the emperor. "What do you think would be the right thing to do if somebody pulled my whiskers?"
"He should be given sweets," said Birbal.
"Sweets?" gasped the other couriers.
"Yes", said Birbal. �Sweets, because the only one who would dare pull His Majesty's whiskers is his grandson."
So pleased was the emperor with the answer that he pulled off his ring and gave it to Birbal as a reward.$$
Birbal arrived late for a function and the emperor was displeased.
"My child was crying and I had to placate him," explained the courtier.
"Does it take so long to calm down a child?" asked the emperor. "It appears you know nothing about child rearing. Now you pretend to be a child and I shall act as your father and I will show you how you should have dealt with your child. Go on. Ask me for whatever he asked of you."
"I want a cow," said Birbal.
Akbar ordered a cow to be brought to the palace.
"I want its milk. I want its milk," said Birbal, imitating the voice of a small child.
"Milk the cow and give to him," said Akbar to his servants.
The cow was milked and the milk was offered to Birbal. He drank a little and then handed the bowl back to Akbar.
"Now put the rest of it back into the cow, put it back, put in back, put it back..." wailed Birbal.
The emperor was flabbergasted and quietly left the room.$$
One day Akbar and Birbal were riding through the countryside and they happened to pass by a cabbage patch.
"Cabbages are such delightful vegetables!" said Akbar. "I just love cabbage."
"The cabbage is king of vegetables!" said Birbal.
A few weeks later they were riding past the cabbage patch again.
This time however, the emperor made a face when he saw the vegetables. "I used to love cabbage but now I have no taste for it." said Akbar.
"The cabbage is a tasteless vegetable" agreed Birbal.
The emperor was astonished.
"But the last time you said it was the king of vegetables!" he said.
"I did," admitted Birbal. "But I am your servant Your Majesty, not the cabbage's."$$

Ram and Sham both claimed ownership of the same mango tree.
One day they approached Birbal and asked him to settle the dispute.
Birbal said to them: "There is only one way to settle the matter. Pluck all the fruits on the tree and divide them equally between the two of you. Then cut down the tree and divide the wood".
Ram thought it was a fair judgment and said so.
But Sham was horrified.
"Your Honor" he said to Birbal "I've tended that tree for seven years. I'd rather let Ram have it than see it cut down."
"Your concern for the tree has told me all I wanted to know" said Birbal, and declared Sham the true owner of the tree.$$
Emperor Akbar was narrating a dream.
The dream began with Akbar and Birbal walking towards each other on a moonless night. It was so dark that they could not see each other and they collided and fell.
"Fortunately for me," said the Emperor. "I fell into a pool of payasam. But guess what Birbal fell into?"
"What, your Majesty?" asked the courtiers.
"A gutter!"
The court resounded with laughter. The emperor was thrilled that for once he had been able to score over Birbal.
But Birbal was unperturbed.
"Your Majesty," he said when the laughter had died down. "Strangely, I too had the same dream. But unlike you I slept on till the end. When you climbed out of that pool of delicious payasam and I, out of that stinking gutter we found that there was no water with which to clean ourselves and so guess what we did?"
"What?" asked the emperor, warily.
"We licked each other clean!"
The emperor became red with embarrassment and resolved never to try to get the better of Birbal again.$$
One Day a scholar came to the court of Emperor Akbar and challenged Birbal to answer his questions and thus prove that he was as clever as people said he was.
He asked Birbal: "Would you prefer to answer a hundred easy questions or just a single difficult one?"
Both the emperor and Birbal had had a difficult day and were impatient to leave.
"Ask me one difficult question," sad Birbal.
"Well, then, tell me," said the man, "which came first into the world, the chicken or the egg?"
"The chicken," replied Birbal.
"How do you know?" asked the scholar, a note of triumph in his voice.
"We had agreed you would ask only one question and you have already asked it" said Birbal and he and the emperor walked away leaving the scholar gaping.$$
Emperor Akbar asked Birbal if it was possible for a man to be the lowest and the noblest t the same time.
"It is possible," said Birbal.
"Then bring me such a person," said the emperor.
Birbal went out and returned with a beggar.
"He is the lowest among your subjects," he said, presenting him to Akbar.
"That might be true," said Akbar. "But I don't see how he can be the noblest."
"He has been given the honor of an audience with the emperor," said Birbal. "That makes him the noblest among beggars."$$
One day Akbar said to Birbal: "Can you tell me how many bangles your wife wears?"
Birbal said he could not.
"You cannot?" exclaimed Akbar. "You see her hands every day while she serves you food. Yet you do not know how many bangles she has on her hands? How is that?"
"Let us go down to the garden, Your Majesty," said Birbal, "and I'll tell you."
They went down the small staircase that led to the garden. Then Birbal turned to the emperor: "Your Majesty," he said, "You go up and down this staircase every day. Can you tell me how many steps there are in the staircase?"
The emperor grinned sheepishly and quickly changed the subject.$$
One day the Emperor Akbar stumbled on a rock in his garden. He was in a foul mood that day and the accident made him so angry that he ordered the gardener�s arrest and execution.
The next day when the gardener was asked what his last wish was before he was hanged, he requested an audience with the emperor.
This wish was granted, but when the man neared the throne he loudly cleared his throat and spat at the emperor�s feet.
The emperor was taken aback and demanded to know why he had done such a thing. The gardener had acted on Birbal�s advice and now Birbal stepped forward in the man�s defence.
"Your Majesty," he said, "there could be no person more loyal to you than this unfortunate man. Fearing that people would say you hanged him for a trifle, he has gone out of his way to give you a genuine reason for hanging him."
The emperor, realizing that he had been about to do a great injustice, set the man free.$$
Famous musicians once gathered at Akbar's court for a competition.
The one who could capture a bull's interest was to be declared the winner.
One by one, they played the most heavenly music but the bull paid no attention.
Then Birbal took the stage. His music sounded like the droning of mosquitoes and the mooing of cows.
But to everyone's amazement the bull suddenly became alert and began to move in a lively manner.
Akbar declared Birbal the winner.$$
A man who made spears and shields once came to Akbar's court.
"Your Majesty, nobody can make shields and spears to equal mine," he said. "My shields are so strong that nothing can pierce them and my spears are so sharp that there's nothing they cannot pierce."
"I can prove you wrong on one count certainly," said Birbal suddenly.
"Impossible!" declared the man.
"Hold up one of your shields and I will pierce it with one of your spears," said Birbal with a smile.$$
The King of Iran had heard that Birbal was one of the wisest men in the East and desirous of meeting him sent him an invitation to visit his country.
In due course, Birbal arrived in Iran.
When he entered the palace he was flabbergasted to find not one but six kings seated there.
All looked alike. All were dressed in kingly robes. Who was the real king?
The very next moment he got his answer. Confidently, he approached the king and bowed to him.
"But how did you identify me?" the king asked, puzzled.
Birbal smiled and explained: "The false kings were all looking at you, while you yourself looked straight ahead. Even in regal robes, the common people will always look to their king for support."
Overjoyed, the king embraced Birbal and showered him with gifts.
